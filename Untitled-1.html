      <h1>Welcome Our new class About HTML</h1>
      <p>
        The <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>, or html is the
        <b>Standard Markup Language</b> for documents designed to be displayed
        in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as cascading
        style sheets (css) and scripting languages such as
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">JavaScript</a>.
        <br />
        html elements are the building blocks of html pages. with html
        constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be
        embedded into the rendered page.
        <small
          >html provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
          structural semantics for</small
        >
        text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
        html elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags
        such as directly introduce content into the page. tags such as surround
        and provide information about document text and may include other tags
        as sub-elements. browsers do not display the html tags, but use them to
        interpret the content of the page. <br />

          html can embed programs written in a scripting language such as
          JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"
            >World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a
          >, former maintainer of the html and current maintainer of the
          cssstandards, has encouraged the use of css over explicit
          presentational html since 1997. a form of html, known as html5, is
          used to display video and audio, primarily using the element, in
          collaboration with javascript.
